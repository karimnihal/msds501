*Assignments in this class are individual. While you may discuss ideas with others, you must submit your own individual effort.*

# Goal

The goal of this assignment is to exercise your understanding of key Python components, such as assignments, expressions, if and loop statements, functions, lists, libraries, and basic programming patterns.

You will write Python code to perform basic image processing tasks on grayscale images. You will implement functions to perform the following image processing tasks:

-- flipping
-- removing noise
-- random cropping
-- fiding edges
-- blurring
-- image sharpening

You will be using pytest to test your code.
