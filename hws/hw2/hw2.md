*Assignments in this class are individual. While you may discuss ideas with others, you must submit your own individual effort.*

# Goal
The goal of this assignment is to exercise your understanding of key Python components, such as assignments, expressions, if and loop statements, functions, lists, libraries, and basic programming patterns.

You will write Python code to perform basic image processing tasks on grayscale images. You will implement functions to perform the following image processing tasks:

- Horizontal flip
- Removing noise
- Blurring
- Center crop

You will be using pytest to test your code.

1. Accept the invitation from the link in Canvas.
2. `git clone` your repo. See the lecture for detailed instructions.
3. Copy the `*jpg, *py, *ipynb from https://github.com/yanneta/msds501/tree/main/hws/hw2 to your repo.
4. Fill the functions in image_util.py.
5. Make sure your solutions pass the unit tests by running:
`pytest`

You should get something like this from running `pytest`:
